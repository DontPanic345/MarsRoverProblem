# Mars Rover Problem

## Alan Falloon

The problem is to take a grid size and then list of rover coordinates and moves to make around the grid. Then to calculate the final position of each rover.

## Installation Instructions
I developed and tested this on Ubuntu.
My node installation was actually handeled by VScode and plugins but using the apt-get method below should work just fine.

```
sudo apt-get install node.js #this will install npm as well
cd /your/test/directory
git clone git@<whatevertheaddressis>
cd marsroverproblem
npm install
```

## How to test it

After installing run `npm test`
